_Survival Pod_ is a mod for the game [Oxygen Not Included](https://www.klei.com/games/oxygen-not-included) from Klei Entertainment, based on the mod [Survival Not Required]([https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2840201171](https://github.com/sungaila/SurvivalNotRequired)). The original mod had the simple intentions of simplifying the first few cycles of survival. This mod wants to explore the expansion of capabilities under a new name because of the polar difference in intent.
